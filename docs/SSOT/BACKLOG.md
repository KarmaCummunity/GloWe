## TRANSLATE — Shared infra

| ID | Task | Owner | Status | Spec |
|----|------|-------|--------|------|
| TRANSLATE-P3 | **Phase 3 — Chat translation (opt-in, last).** Sender-consent gate; per-conversation translation; LRU cache eviction for chat. | agent-fullstack | ⏳ Planned | `spec/18_translation.md` FR-TRANSLATE-004 (to be detailed) |

## Shared — Research / Infra / Perf

| ID | Task | Owner | Status | Spec |
|----|------|-------|--------|------|
| P1.7 | FR-RESEARCH-001..003 — Public market research form | agent-be + agent-fe | 🟡 In progress (post-merge QA) | `spec/16_public_research.md` |
| P1.8 | FR-RESEARCH-004 — Share affordance for public research survey | agent-fe | 🟡 Code complete, post-merge QA pending | `spec/16_public_research.md` |
| INFRA-QA-W1 | Playwright P0 E2E gate on dev + release (release lane `ci-release.yml`, `tests/e2e/`) | infra | 🟡 In progress | Wave 1 |
| INFRA-QA-W2 | E2E domain expansion (posts, chat send, donations, research) | infra | ⏳ Planned | Wave 2 |
| INFRA-QA-W3 | RLS persona integration suite | infra | ⏳ Planned | Wave 3 |
| INFRA-QA-W4 | Performance budgets (Lighthouse + k6) | infra | ⏳ Planned | Wave 4 |
| INFRA-QA-W5 | Accessibility axe gate | infra | ⏳ Planned | Wave 5 |
| INFRA-QA-W7 | Expanded prod synthetic monitoring | infra | 🟡 In progress | Wave 7 — KC deploy smoke (`deploy-smoke.yml`) |
| INFRA-OSS-4 | **Snyk PR scan** | infra | 🟡 In progress | `SECURITY.md` |
| INFRA-OSS-6 | **GitGuardian** | infra | 🟡 In progress | `SECURITY.md` |
| PERF-4 | **Image delivery — upload-time thumbs + backfill** | agent-fullstack | 🟡 In progress | TD-11 |
| PERF-5 | **DB consolidation — per-chat unread count RPC** | agent-fullstack | 🟡 In progress | Migration `0133` |
| SEC-1063 | **DB function privileges (#1063).** `EXECUTE` is an explicit decision of each migration: new functions private by default, SECURITY DEFINER triggers and internal helpers service-role only, anon limited to the reviewed public-read list (`0520`); guarded by `supabase/tests/0520_*` and `scripts/check-rpc-grants.mjs` (CI backend lane). Remaining: verify on kc-dev after the Deploy run. | agent-be | 🟡 Code complete — kc-dev verification pending | [ADR-002 §2](../architecture/adr/ADR-002-data-layer.md) |
| SEC-1065 | **Account deletion removes all of the user's media (#1065, FR-SETTINGS-012 AC2).** `delete-account` purges the user's folder in every user-owned bucket (`avatars`, `post-images`, `chat-media`, `listing-images`); a failing bucket is reported and the others still run. Remaining: verify on kc-dev after the Deploy run. | agent-be | 🟡 Code complete — kc-dev verification pending | [`spec/11_settings.md`](./spec/11_settings.md) FR-SETTINGS-012 |
| SEC-1067 | **Worker endpoints accept only the service-role key (#1067).** `receipts-issuer`, `subscriptions-charger`, `whatsapp-intake-worker` and `whatsapp-sender` check their caller with `_shared/serviceRoleGuard.ts` right after their method guard; a regression test enforces it, and the deploy smoke now probes every function (TD-219 closed). Remaining: verify on kc-dev after the Deploy run. | agent-be | 🟡 Code complete — kc-dev verification pending | [ADR-002 §2](../architecture/adr/ADR-002-data-layer.md) |
| SEC-1064 | **Chat images are private (#1064).** The `chat-media` bucket is no longer public; an image is readable by whoever can see its chat (`is_chat_visible_to`, the messages' predicate, `0521`), and the app shows it through a short-lived signed URL from `media_payload.path` (`chatMediaUrl.ts`, `ChatMediaImage`). Remaining: verify on kc-dev after the Deploy run; installed store builds older than this change show no chat images until they update. | agent-fullstack | 🟡 Code complete — kc-dev verification pending | [ADR-002 §3](../architecture/adr/ADR-002-data-layer.md) |

## INFRA — CI/CD hardening (`D-195`)

Stages 1, 2, 3 and 6 (`INFRA-CI-1` unified PR gate, `INFRA-CI-2` gate integrity, `INFRA-CI-3` gated prod release, `INFRA-CI-6` agent bot identity) are done in code — see [`archive/BACKLOG-history.md`](./archive/BACKLOG-history.md); stages 4 and 5 (`INFRA-CI-4` nightly mobile, `INFRA-CI-5` docs drift) are done too (rows below); their repository settings are `INFRA-CI-OWNER`. Rows that change CI files need owner approval (`D-195`).

| ID | Task | Owner | Status | Spec |
|----|------|-------|--------|------|
| INFRA-CI-OWNER | **Owner settings for the D-195 pipeline (owner action).** Live state (2026-10-31): `dev` already has the ruleset `dev protection (merge queue)` requiring only `CI gate`, with the repository-admin bypass; `main` still has classic protection with eight legacy required checks — **switch `main` to `CI gate` only** before the next release. #1292, #1308 and #1319 are merged. Remaining checklist: agent GitHub App in the `main`-only `agent-merge` environment (`TD-240`) + Write-role machine user, Claude Code reconnected to it; CI-verdict GitHub App in the `main`-only `ci-verdict` environment; move sensitive repository secrets into environments (`TD-223`); prod environments, variables, Cloudflare token; `mobile-store` + EAS `preview` + iOS signing + `mobile/*` tags for the nightly (#1304, merged); import `.github/rulesets/dev-main.json` (reconciled with the live `dev` ruleset) and verify, then require `CI verdict` from the CI-verdict App once `ci-verdict.yml` is on `main`; delete `tmp-probe-*` workflows and branch `chore/ci-nightly-mobile`. | owner | ⏳ Planned | [`OPERATOR_RUNBOOK.md` § Owner setup for D-195 CI/CD](./OPERATOR_RUNBOOK.md#owner-setup-ci) |
| INFRA-CI-4 | **Nightly mobile pipeline.** Scheduled TestFlight + Play internal builds from the last `dev` SHA whose `CI gate` passed (`mobile-nightly.yml`; kc-dev backend via the eas.json `nightly` profile, verified in the built bundle). Owner setup: `ENVIRONMENTS.md` § Production release. | infra | ✅ Done | `D-195`, `D-192` |
| INFRA-CI-5 | **CI docs drift cleanup.** Bring `docs/dev/**`, `TESTING.md`, `SECURITY.md`, `OPERATOR_RUNBOOK.md` and agent docs in line with the single-gate layout; drop references to removed workflows. Done 2026-10-31: Railway → Cloudflare Pages, removed workflows, required-check lists → `CI gate`, live ruleset state, bundle id `org.karmacommunity.app`; Sonar coverage exclusions aligned with vitest (tests added for the upload services, error maps, `authStore`, `openExternalUrl`); `edited`-event re-runs logged as `TD-233`. | infra | ✅ Done | `D-195` |

## DONATE — Money hub

| ID | Task | Owner | Status | Spec |
|----|------|-------|--------|------|

| OPS-G42 | **Health registry + monitor + alert router.** Shipped: `ops.health_checks` + 7 checks (`0463`), hourly dev + prod run, GitHub-issue alerts (→ email) with auto-close. Open: WhatsApp channel once live, synthetic web check. | agent-fullstack | 🟡 In progress | §5.2 · G42 |
| OPS-G39 | **Port contract tests** (fake + Supabase adapter, same suite). Shipped: framework-agnostic contract kit (`@kc/application` `contracts/`), `IPostRepository` contract (9 owner-lifecycle cases) run against a behavioural `InMemoryPostRepository` in `pnpm test` and against `SupabasePostRepository` on the local stack in `ci-backend`; `ISavedPostsRepository` contract (8 bookmark cases: idempotent save, per-user rows, readability gate on save, bookmark kept while the post is unreadable, cascade on post delete) run against `InMemorySavedPostsRepository` and `SupabaseSavedPostsRepository` the same way. Next ports, in order: `IChatRepository`, `IRideListingRepository` + `IRideParticipantRepository` (G1 safety net), `IUserRepository`, `IReportRepository`. | agent-fullstack | 🟡 In progress | §5.1 · G39 · `D-204` |
| OPS-G40 | **Two-user E2E journey per active world.** Shipped: one journey shape (`tests/e2e/lib/worldJourney.ts`: A publishes through the create RPC → B claims on the listing page → A confirms (when the world needs it) → A hands over, listing closes, karma written → B rates) with one fixture per live world: `journeys/items.spec.ts`, `journeys/food.spec.ts` (quick claim is confirmed at once). Top-level journeys run in the nightly, the mobile-nightly P0 gate and the release lane. Next: `time` once its launch flag is on, `rides` with the post-based flow (G44), knowledge in phase 2. | agent-fe | 🟡 In progress | §5.1 · G40 · `D-205` |

## POSTS & FEED — One create form, every category everywhere (PM, 2026-11-01)

| ID | Task | Owner | Status | Spec |
|----|------|-------|--------|------|
| CREATE-5CAT | **Create form cleanup + TestFlight crash.** Category picker (items, rides, food, housing, time) with the last used category + direction remembered, request / offer under it, curated fields per category and direction; no inline native date picker or slider; "donations marketplace" card and browse screen removed (`/donations/marketplace` → hub, "my listings" in the profile menu). Tests: field-spec units, a jsdom render matrix of every category × direction with full ride / time publishes, Maestro flow `13-create-form-categories`. | agent-fe | ✅ Done | `spec/04_posts.md` FR-POST-001 AC6 · `spec/13_donations.md` FR-DONATE-001 AC6 · `D-207` |
| FEED-WORLDS | **Main feed of every category + a feed per world.** (1) Turn on `worlds.feed_mirror` for rides, housing and time so their listings reach the main feed like items and food (`0466`); check feed cards for ride / stay / shift details. (2) Give each active world screen search, "request" / "offer" buttons (create form preset by `createRouteFor` + direction) and the world's feed of open offers and requests, with `BrowseRefineChips` where the world has subcategories; housing and time get a world screen (today: links-only category screen / org opportunities). (3) Rides, time and housing launch flags are seeded off (`0441`) — the create form offers them regardless; flip the flags when their world screens ship. Old KC repo for reference screens. **(1) done** — `0522` (FR-FEED-020 AC1): rides, housing and time mirror into the main feed, cards show the world chip + icon. **(2) items, food, rides done** — world header with request / offer + sub-screens, world feed with search, direction and refine chips. Next: housing and time world screens, then (3) flags. | agent-fullstack | 🟡 In progress | `spec/06_feed_and_search.md` FR-FEED-020 · `docs/spec/07` §7.3 · `TD-246`, `TD-245` |

## UI — Shared kit (`docs/spec/17_brand_and_design_system.md` §4.1, epic #1061)

| ID | Task | Owner | Status | Spec |
|----|------|-------|--------|------|
| UI-KIT-1 | **Phase 1 — `Modal`, `BottomSheet`, `Chip`, sized buttons.** Kit components on tokens with tests; brand guard `rawModal` made import-aware and `adHocChip` added; migration inventory in spec 17 §4.1.1. Adds `DangerButton` for destructive actions (D94). PM approved the look 2026-11-01. | agent-fe | ✅ Done | §4.1 · #1284 #1285 #1286 |
| UI-KIT-2 | **Phase 2 — migrate screens onto the kit**, one area per PR (sheets, dialogs, chips, CTAs), lowering the brand-guard baseline each time. Sheets: 8 of 9 sheet components on `BottomSheet` (`SearchablePicker` deferred). Dialogs: 13 of 14 centred dialogs on `Modal` (`LegalConsentScreen` exit confirm waits for `LegalConsentGate`). Chips: 7 of 8 exported and all 3 local chip components on `Chip` (`ChatReactionChips` kept: a reaction counter, not a kit chip). CTAs: onboarding, auth and closure on kit buttons (CTAs 1); the other areas follow. See `TD-243`. | agent-fe | 🟡 In progress | §4.1.1 · `TD-243` |
| UI-ADMIN-1 | **Admin surfaces on brand tokens (#1287, D67).** One admin area per PR to zero brand-guard findings, values snapped to the nearest token (the smaller on a tie: admin is the denser layout). ✅ `components/admin/admins` (13 files); ✅ shared admin components, `reports`, `tasks` rows (16 files); ✅ admin home, `money`, `whatsapp`, `time`, `crm`, survey cards (8 files). Left: 23 admin files in the baseline (spec 17 §4.3 progress line). | agent-fe | 🟡 In progress | [`spec/17`](../spec/17_brand_and_design_system.md) §4.3 |

## Deferred (post-MVP, still tracked)

| ID | Task | Status | Spec |
|----|------|--------|------|
| P3.1 | Block / unblock + visibility restoration | ⏳ Deferred (EXEC-9) | `spec/08_moderation.md` FR-MOD-003/004/009 |
| P3.MATCH-XW | **Cross-world matching** (improvement, P3). Goal: pair listings across worlds when one enables the other (item give ↔ ride offer for pickup/delivery; food give ↔ volunteer time for distribution). AC: opt-in per world pair in `matching_settings`; reuses `match_candidates` with a `link_kind`; geo/time windows of both legs respected; never notifies above the per-user cap; SQL test + seed sample; off by default. | ⏳ Deferred (PM 2026-10-18) | `docs/SSOT/MATCHING_V2.md` |
