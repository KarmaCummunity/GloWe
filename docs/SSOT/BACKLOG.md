## INFRA — CI/CD hardening (`D-195`)

Stages 1, 2, 3 and 6 (`INFRA-CI-1` unified PR gate, `INFRA-CI-2` gate integrity, `INFRA-CI-3` gated prod release, `INFRA-CI-6` agent bot identity) are done in code — see [`archive/BACKLOG-history.md`](./archive/BACKLOG-history.md); stages 4 and 5 (`INFRA-CI-4` nightly mobile, `INFRA-CI-5` docs drift) are done too (rows below); their repository settings are `INFRA-CI-OWNER`. Rows that change CI files need owner approval (`D-195`).

| ID | Task | Owner | Status | Spec |
|----|------|-------|--------|------|
| INFRA-CI-OWNER | **Owner settings for the D-195 pipeline (owner action).** Live state (2026-10-31): `dev` already has the ruleset `dev protection (merge queue)` requiring only `CI gate`, with the repository-admin bypass; `main` still has classic protection with eight legacy required checks — **switch `main` to `CI gate` only** before the next release. #1292, #1308 and #1319 are merged. Remaining checklist: agent GitHub App in the `main`-only `agent-merge` environment (`TD-240`) + Write-role machine user, Claude Code reconnected to it; CI-verdict GitHub App in the `main`-only `ci-verdict` environment; move sensitive repository secrets into environments (`TD-223`); prod environments, variables, Cloudflare token; `mobile-store` + EAS `preview` + iOS signing + `mobile/*` tags for the nightly (#1304, merged); import `.github/rulesets/dev-main.json` (reconciled with the live `dev` ruleset) and verify, then require `CI verdict` from the CI-verdict App once `ci-verdict.yml` is on `main`; delete `tmp-probe-*` workflows and branch `chore/ci-nightly-mobile`. | owner | ⏳ Planned | [`OPERATOR_RUNBOOK.md` § Owner setup for D-195 CI/CD](./OPERATOR_RUNBOOK.md#owner-setup-ci) |
| INFRA-CI-4 | **Nightly mobile pipeline.** Scheduled TestFlight + Play internal builds from the last `dev` SHA whose `CI gate` passed (`mobile-nightly.yml`; kc-dev backend via the eas.json `nightly` profile, verified in the built bundle). Owner setup: `ENVIRONMENTS.md` § Production release. | infra | ✅ Done | `D-195`, `D-192` |
| INFRA-CI-5 | **CI docs drift cleanup.** Bring `docs/dev/**`, `TESTING.md`, `SECURITY.md`, `OPERATOR_RUNBOOK.md` and agent docs in line with the single-gate layout; drop references to removed workflows. Done 2026-10-31: Railway → Cloudflare Pages, removed workflows, required-check lists → `CI gate`, live ruleset state, bundle id `org.karmacommunity.app`; Sonar coverage exclusions aligned with vitest (tests added for the upload services, error maps, `authStore`, `openExternalUrl`); `edited`-event re-runs logged as `TD-233`. | infra | ✅ Done | `D-195` |

## Sprint Protocol

1. Pick the highest `⏳` item in **this file** (not `archive/`)
2. Read its linked `spec/` file
3. Move status to 🟡
4. Implement
5. Move status to ✅ **and** append/move the row to `archive/BACKLOG-history.md`
6. Update spec file status if all ACs complete
