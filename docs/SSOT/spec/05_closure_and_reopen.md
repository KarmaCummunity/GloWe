# 2.5 Posts: Closure & Reopen

> **Status:** ✅ Core Complete — Close with/without recipient, reopen, chat fan-out shipped. **Audit 2026-05-29:** closure candidates scoped to `anchor_post_id` (FR-CLOSURE-003 AC1). Counter drift on `rpc_recipient_unmark_self` + `reopen_post_deleted_no_recipient` (TD-71) closed by migration `0149` under P2.16. FR-CLOSURE-007 still silent on whether `closed_delivered → deleted_no_recipient` from unmark should emit a system message in anchored chats (see `docs/SSOT/archive/audit/2026-05-16/03_posts_closure_feed.md` POST-16).



Prefix: `FR-CLOSURE-*`

## Scope

The most KPI-critical workflow in the MVP: marking a post as delivered. Two paths (with recipient / without), a multi-step dialog, statistics propagation, the reopen mechanism, and the recipient's ability to un-mark themselves.

This is the only domain whose changes directly move the **North Star Metric** (Closed-Delivered Posts).

---

## FR-CLOSURE-001 — Initiate closure

**Description.**
The owner of an `open` post taps "Mark as Delivered" from Post Detail.

**Source.**
- PRD: `03_Core_Features.md` §3.3.6 (sub-section א), `04_User_Flows.md` Flow 7.

**Acceptance Criteria.**
- AC1. The action is visible only on the owner's view of an `open` post.
- AC2. Tapping it opens **Closure Step 1** (`FR-CLOSURE-002`); no state change occurs until the user confirms.
- AC3. Cancellation at any closure step leaves the post unchanged in `open`.
- AC4. On successful close (regardless of trigger location — post detail screen or chat anchor card per FR-CHAT-015), the database fans out to every `Chat` with `anchor_post_id = postId` and inserts a `kind='system'` message describing the outcome. See FR-CHAT-015 AC4-AC6 for the bodies and `system_payload` schema.
- AC5. When closure completes successfully from **post detail**, the client shows a short success toast, navigates back (or to the main tabs shell if there is no stack history), and invalidates list caches (including profile closed-posts) so feeds and profile grids are not stale. **Reopen** from the same screen uses the same toast + back pattern (see FR-CLOSURE-005 AC7).
- AC6. (P1.2.x) Clear anchor on close: after the system-message fan-out in AC4, the same closure trigger sets `chats.anchor_post_id = NULL` for every chat that was anchored to the closed post. The clear runs after the message inserts (so the loop still finds the anchored chats) and applies to both `closed_delivered` and `deleted_no_recipient` transitions. Pairs with FR-CHAT-014 AC6 (re-anchor on next entry from a different post). Implemented in `supabase/migrations/0026_chat_anchor_lifecycle.sql`.

## FR-CLOSURE-002 — Closure Step 1: confirm delivery

**Description.**
The first modal asks whether the item was actually delivered.

**Source.**
- PRD: `03_Core_Features.md` §3.3.6, `05_Screen_UI_Mapping.md` §6.4.1.
- Constraints: `R-MVP-Items-4`.

**Acceptance Criteria.**
- AC1. The copy emphasizes that closure should happen **after** the physical handoff, not after a coordination message.
- AC2. Two buttons: "Yes, delivered" (primary) → advances to Step 2 (`FR-CLOSURE-003`); "Cancel" (secondary) → dismiss.
- AC3. Telemetry event `closure_step1_completed` fires upon confirmation (see [`06_cross_cutting/01_analytics_and_events.md`](../archive/SRS/06_cross_cutting/01_analytics_and_events.md)).

**Related.** Screens: 6.4.1.

## FR-CLOSURE-003 — Closure Step 2: pick recipient (optional)

**Description.**
The second modal offers a recipient picker built from the set of users who messaged the owner about this post.

**Source.**
- PRD: `03_Core_Features.md` §3.3.6, `05_Screen_UI_Mapping.md` §6.4.2.

**Acceptance Criteria.**
- AC1. The recipient picker lists every distinct user who has at least one message in a chat thread anchored to this post (or this post's owner with reference to this post — see `FR-CHAT-004`).
- AC2. The list is sorted by recency of latest message; each row shows avatar, name, optional city.
- AC3. Two CTAs: "Mark and Close" (primary, requires a selection) and "Close without marking" (secondary).
- AC4. If no chat partners exist, the picker shows an empty state and only "Close without marking" is enabled.
- AC5. On "Mark and Close": post status moves to `closed_delivered`; a `Recipient { post, user, marked_at }` row is created.
- AC6. On "Close without marking": post status moves to `deleted_no_recipient` with `delete_after = now() + 7 days`.
- AC7. Both paths advance to Step 3 (`FR-CLOSURE-004`).

## FR-CLOSURE-004 — Closure Step 3: educational note (one-time)

**Description.**
A one-time explanation of the closure mechanism, dismissible forever.

**Source.**
- PRD: `03_Core_Features.md` §3.3.6 (sub-section א, Step 4), `05_Screen_UI_Mapping.md` §6.4.3.

**Acceptance Criteria.**
- AC1. Shown the first time the user closes a post (with or without recipient) and on every subsequent closure until they tick "Don't show this again".
- AC2. Copy explains: marked posts are kept forever; unmarked posts are deleted after 7 days; personal stats update either way.
- AC3. Setting persists per user as `User.closure_explainer_dismissed = true`.

**Related.** Screens: 6.4.3.

## FR-CLOSURE-005 — Reopen a closed post

**Description.**
The owner can return a `closed_delivered` post (or a `deleted_no_recipient` post still inside the 7-day grace window) to `open` status.

**Source.**
- PRD: `03_Core_Features.md` §3.3.6 (sub-section ב), `04_User_Flows.md` Flow 7 (חלק ב).
- Constraints: `R-MVP-Items-6`, `R-MVP-Items-7`.
- Decisions: `D-6`.

**Acceptance Criteria.**
- AC1. The primary CTA for reopening uses the shared *"item not delivered"* framing (`closure.itemNotDeliveredCta`); behavior remains reopen per AC3–AC7.
- AC2. Confirmation modal warns about consequences and (when relevant) that the recipient mark will be removed.
- AC3. On confirm, the post's status returns to `open`. If the post was `closed_delivered`:
   - The associated `Recipient` row is deleted.
   - The recipient's `items_received_count` decrements by 1 (`D-6`).
   - **No** push notification is sent to the recipient (`D-6`); they observe the change passively when they next view their closed-posts tab.
- AC4. If the post was `deleted_no_recipient` and within the grace window, reopening cancels the scheduled deletion (`bg-job-soft-delete-cleanup`).
- AC5. The owner's `items_given_count` decrements by 1 to keep totals consistent.
- AC6. There is no upper bound on reopen count; however, after 5 reopens a `Suspect` flag is raised (`R-MVP-Items-7`), surfacing the post for admin review (`FR-MOD-008`).
- AC7. When reopen completes successfully from **post detail**, the client shows a short success toast and navigates back (same shell behavior as FR-CLOSURE-001 AC5), after list caches are refreshed.

**Edge Cases.**
- The post was `removed_admin`: cannot be reopened (only the Super Admin may restore it via `FR-ADMIN-002`).
- The post is past the 7-day grace window of `deleted_no_recipient`: it has been hard-deleted; "Reopen" is no longer available.
- The recipient has since deleted their account: reopen still works; no decrement is applied to a non-existent user.

## FR-CLOSURE-006 — Recipient receives a one-time educational notification

**Description.**
The recipient (when marked) is informed about being credited.

**Source.**
- PRD: `03_Core_Features.md` §3.3.6 (sub-section א).
- Decisions: `D-5`.

**Acceptance Criteria.**
- AC1. On `Recipient` creation, a notification (`FR-NOTIF-009`) — Critical category — is delivered to the recipient.
- AC2. Copy: *"[Owner name] marked you as the receiver of [post title]. Thanks for being part of the community!"*
- AC3. The notification deep-links to the recipient's view of the post (`FR-POST-017`).

**Related.** Domain: `Notification`, `Recipient`.

## FR-CLOSURE-007 — Recipient un-marks themselves

**Description.**
The recipient can remove their recipient mark from a post they were credited with.

**Source.**
- Decisions: `D-7`.

**Acceptance Criteria.**
- AC1. Available only on the recipient's view of `FR-POST-017` for posts in `closed_delivered`.
- AC1b. The primary CTA label matches the shared *"item not delivered"* copy (`closure.unmarkSelfCta`); behavior remains un-mark per AC3–AC4.
- AC2. Confirmation modal explains the consequences: *"You will no longer be credited for this item, and the post owner will be notified that you removed your mark."*
- AC3. On confirm:
   - The `Recipient` row is deleted.
   - `items_received_count` of the recipient decrements by 1.
   - `items_given_count` of the owner decrements by 1.
   - A notification (`FR-NOTIF-013`) — Critical category — informs the owner.
   - The post status remains `closed_delivered` (the post is still considered delivered, just to no specific recipient). To preserve post integrity it transitions to `deleted_no_recipient` with `delete_after = now() + 7 days` so the owner can either reopen, re-mark a different recipient, or let it expire.
- AC4. Audit event recorded (`R-MVP-Safety-3`).

**Edge Cases.**
- If the owner has already deleted their account: the un-mark proceeds; no notification is delivered.
- If the post is concurrently reopened by the owner during the same race: the system serializes the operations such that the final state is `open` with no `Recipient` row and consistent counters.

## FR-CLOSURE-008 — Cleanup of unmarked closures

**Description.**
A scheduled job hard-deletes posts that ended in `deleted_no_recipient` after the 7-day grace window.

**Source.**
- PRD: `03_Core_Features.md` §3.3.6 (sub-section א, Step 3).

**Acceptance Criteria.**
- AC1. `bg-job-soft-delete-cleanup` (see [`06_cross_cutting/05_background_jobs.md`](../archive/SRS/06_cross_cutting/05_background_jobs.md)) runs daily.
- AC2. Posts whose `delete_after` has passed are hard-deleted along with their image assets.
- AC3. Reopen of a `deleted_no_recipient` post cancels the scheduled deletion (already in `FR-CLOSURE-005`).
- AC4. The job emits a metric `closure_cleanup_deleted_total` for observability.

**Related.** Domain: `Post`.

## FR-CLOSURE-009 — Statistics propagation invariants

**Description.**
The closure flow has strict invariants on counters.

**Source.**
- PRD: `03_Core_Features.md` §3.6.
- Constraints: `R-MVP-Items-4`.

**Acceptance Criteria.**
- AC1. **Items given**: `User.items_given_count` increments **only** when a post moves to `closed_delivered` or `deleted_no_recipient`. Reopen, recipient un-mark, and admin removal decrement appropriately.
- AC2. **Items received**: `User.items_received_count` increments **only** on `Recipient` creation; decrements on its deletion (reopen, recipient un-mark, admin removal of the post).
- AC3. The two counters are computed via materialized projections (Postgres triggers + denormalized columns); the projection logic is owned by the Application layer.
- AC4. Drift detection: a daily job recomputes ground-truth counters from event logs and asserts equivalence; mismatches alert and log (`NFR-RELI-005`).

**Related.** Domain: `Statistic`, `User`.

## FR-CLOSURE-010 — Suspect flag at 5+ reopens

**Description.**
A post that has been reopened 5 or more times triggers a moderation flag.

**Source.**
- Constraints: `R-MVP-Items-7`.

**Acceptance Criteria.**
- AC1. Each successful reopen increments `Post.reopen_count`.
- AC2. When `reopen_count >= 5`, the post is added to the moderation queue (`FR-MOD-008`) with reason `excessive_reopens`.
- AC3. The user is **not** notified of the flag (we don't want to encourage gaming).
- AC4. The flag is informational; the post remains `open` until the Super Admin acts.

**Related.** Domain: `Post.reopen_count`, `ModerationQueueEntry`.
