# Migration range registry

**Rule:** before writing a migration, claim a range here, in your PR or a small docs PR to `dev`. Use only numbers inside your range. Files are `supabase/migrations/NNNN_snake_case.sql`. Gaps are fine; collisions are not.

Last applied on kc-dev when this was written: `0239`.
