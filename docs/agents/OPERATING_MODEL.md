# KC agent operating model

How AI agents (and humans) ship work on KC. Rules in [`CLAUDE.md`](../../CLAUDE.md) still apply; this file says **who does what** and **how work flows**.

## Roles

| Role | Owns | Typical paths |
|---|---|---|
| **Coordinator** | Board, issue writing, migration range claims, stack order, merges to `dev` | `docs/agents/**`, GitHub Project |
| **DB** | Schema, RLS, RPCs, crons, Edge Functions, generated types | `supabase/**`, `app/packages/infrastructure-supabase/**` |
| **Mobile/UI** | Expo app, native polish, performance on device | `app/apps/mobile/**`, `app/packages/ui/**` |
| **Marketplace** | Giving worlds (money, time, items, ...), search, matching UI | `app/apps/mobile/app/**` marketplace routes + their RPCs |
| **Bot** | WhatsApp bot, MCP/bot API | `supabase/functions/whatsapp*/**`, bot packages |
| **QA/Reviewer** | Review PRs, run tests, verify on kc-dev, file bugs | any (read), `tests/**` |

One agent = one issue at a time. Don't edit paths owned by another role without saying so in the PR.

## Flow

```
issue (agent_task form) -> branch from origin/dev -> PR to dev -> CI green
  -> label agent-ready -> auto-merge (squash) -> DB deploy + Deploy Web -> verify on kc-dev
```

1. **Issue**: use the `Agent task` form. It needs acceptance criteria, and a migration range if it touches SQL.
2. **Branch**: `<type>/<issue#>-<area>-<slug>`, for example `feat/905-marketplace-map`.
3. **PR**: base `dev`. The body includes `Closes #N` and `Mapped to spec` (required by CI — PR hygiene).
4. **CI**: all required checks green. Don't disable or skip a gate. Fix the cause, or add a documented exception.
5. **Merge**: add the `agent-ready` label. [`auto-merge-agent-ready.yml`](../../.github/workflows/auto-merge-agent-ready.yml) enables squash auto-merge, and GitHub merges once required checks pass. Stacked PRs: merge the base first (see [STACK_MAP.md](./STACK_MAP.md)).
6. **Issues close on merge**: GitHub only honors `Closes #N` on merges into `main`, so [`close-issues-on-dev-merge.yml`](../../.github/workflows/close-issues-on-dev-merge.yml) closes the referenced issues when a PR merges into `dev` (plus a daily sweep as backstop). Use `Closes #N` only when the PR fully finishes the issue; use `Refs #N` / `Part of #N` otherwise.
7. **Deploy**: a push to `dev` runs `DB deploy` (supabase-dev / kc-dev) and `Deploy Web` (dev.karma-community.pages.dev). Verify there.
8. **`main` / prod (kc-prod)**: **only with Nave's explicit approval.** Agents never push to or merge into `main`, never run prod deploy workflows, and never touch kc-prod.

## Labels

- `area:*`, `database`: set automatically from paths by [`labeler.yml`](../../.github/labeler.yml).
- `agent-ready`: the author's or coordinator's signal that the PR is done and may auto-merge.
- `epic`, `size:*`: set by the coordinator.

## Weekly hygiene

[`stale-stack-report.yml`](../../.github/workflows/stale-stack-report.yml) prints open PRs into `dev` with failing checks, conflicts, or no activity for 3+ days to the job summary. The coordinator works through that list.

## Secrets

Secrets live only in encrypted GitHub environment secrets. Never print, echo, commit or paste them in issues or PRs.

## Releases

Mobile/store versioning and promotion: [RELEASE.md](./RELEASE.md).
