## Blocked on keys / access (Nave)

- **Apple:** App Store Connect app record + `ascAppId` in `eas.json` (`submit.production.ios.ascAppId` is a placeholder), ASC API key (Issuer ID, Key ID, .p8) as EAS / GitHub secrets, Apple Team ID.
- **Expo:** `EXPO_TOKEN` (EAS build + submit).
- **Google Play:** Play Console app record, service-account JSON for `eas submit` (`google-play-service-account.json`, never committed — EAS secret), first AAB uploaded manually once (Play requirement).
- **Prod Edge Functions:** `delete-account` must be deployed to prod too (prod functions workflow is disabled by policy).

## Decisions Nave must make (business / legal)

1. **Legal text sign-off.** Privacy policy + terms are drafts based on the in-app v2 documents, updated for current processors (Supabase, Cloudflare, Expo, Google/Apple sign-in, Google Gemini translation, Meta WhatsApp, Sentry, PostHog, payment provider). A lawyer should review. The in-app v2 privacy text says "deleted account: 30 days then hard delete", but the app deletes immediately — the draft says immediate; the in-app document should be republished to match.
2. **Money donations on iOS (guideline 3.2.1(vi) / 3.2.2(iv)).** In-app donations are only allowed for Apple-approved nonprofits (with Apple Pay) or by linking out to the browser. Options: (a) hide the money world on iOS for v1, (b) open donations in Safari, (c) apply as an approved nonprofit. Recommendation: (a) or (b) for the first TestFlight/App Store build.
3. **Retention of financial records on account deletion.** Implemented as: payments, receipts and donation intents are kept but de-identified (user link removed). Confirm this matches accounting obligations.
4. **24-hour report handling.** Terms commit to reviewing reports within 24 hours (Apple expects timely action on UGC reports). Confirm someone owns the moderation queue.
5. **Store name.** Proposed "קהילת קארמה – נתינה" / "Karma Community: Give & Get" (name must be unique on the App Store).
6. **Review account.** Apple/Google reviewers need a working login on prod (email + password) and notes; create a dedicated reviewer account on prod.
7. **Support URL.** Done: `/support` (he + en). Confirm the support email `karmacommunity2.0@gmail.com` is the one to publish.
8. **WhatsApp bot data** (phone numbers) is collected outside the app but by the same service — include it in the App Privacy answers (done below) or keep the bot separate.

## Age rating answers (draft)

Apple (questionnaire) — expected result **13+**, matching the 13+ minimum age in the terms:
- Violence, sexual content/nudity, profanity, horror, mature/suggestive themes, alcohol/tobacco/drugs, simulated gambling, contests, medical/treatment info: **None**
- User-generated content: **Yes** (posts, listings, comments, photos) — moderated, report + block available
- Messaging / chat between users: **Yes**
- Unrestricted web access: **No**
- Made for kids: **No**

Google Play (IARC): category *Social / Communication*; users can interact and exchange content: **Yes**; shares user's current location with others: **No** (city only, typed by the user); digital purchases: **No** (donations go to nonprofits via a payment provider, not in-app purchases); expected rating **Teen / PEGI 12**.
