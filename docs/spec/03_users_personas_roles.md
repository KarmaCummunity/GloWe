**Management hierarchy view (D68, D69).** The admin portal presents every role holder above as layers across all organizations, one layer per level of the reporting chain. Depth is not fixed: inside an org a manager can report to a manager who reports to a manager, down to a volunteer manager and a volunteer, and each link adds a layer. The community stands under the layers and is shown as a count only, never as identities. A suspended user is a regular member until an admin decides (D69). Visibility follows D29: the main admin sees every org; anyone else sees the orgs their own roles belong to. Self-declared org affiliations are counted, never shown as granted roles. Tech: FR-ADMIN-028 (`docs/SSOT/spec/12_super_admin.md` §17), `admin_hierarchy_census` (migration `0461`).

**Team management (D76, D77).** From any person in the hierarchy — or any user found in the admin search — a team manager opens one person screen and manages that person end to end: sees their roles and where each applies, grants a new role, changes a role in place (the person keeps their manager and their reports), revokes a role, and sets their direct manager. Permissions come from the role only (D76): the screen lists what each role allows, and changing permissions means changing the role. Every organization runs its own team (D77): its admins and managers manage their own organization below them, within their authority; the main admin manages every organization. Tech: FR-ADMIN-030 (`docs/SSOT/spec/12_super_admin.md` §18), `admin_change_role` and the org-scoped `admin_list_admins` (migration `0465`).
