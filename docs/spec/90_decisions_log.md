# 90 — Decisions log

Index only — the binding wording lives in the linked spec files. All decided by Nave (PM), 2026-10. `*` = needs further depth. A new row takes a `D` placeholder ID, numbered on merge (`CLAUDE.md` §4 "New registry IDs").

| D57 | Social venture = org; any registered org (incl. private person) may post jobs | 08 | Approved |
| D58 | Standing goals: spec maintenance, store release + updates, modular scalable code | 00 | Approved |
| D59 | Items and all requests never expire; instead the owner gets relevance reminders (S3: 14 days after publish, then every 30 days) — answers P5 | 07.1 | Approved (PM 2026-10-30) |
| D60 | Every world is shown in full. Two kinds: **active** worlds (full in-app flow, e.g. items, rides) and **portal** worlds (links + knowledge + org blocks). Launch flags choose active vs portal; they never hide a world — refines D3, answers Q-1 | 04, 14 | Approved (PM 2026-10-30) |
| D61 | Moderation: 3 distinct reports on a post → `hidden_pending_review` + admin notification; 5 distinct reporters on a user in 30 days → suspended from actions, can still chat with support — confirms D33/S11, answers Q-2 | 07.15 | Approved (PM 2026-10-30) |
| D62 | Code follows the spec list: 8 giving worlds + 11 domains (D45). Legacy code worlds map to it (`app_design` removed per D18; `medical`, `animals`, `environment`, `creative`→`culture` become domains). Every world and every domain gets its own screen tree under the Donations tab — answers Q-3 | 04, 05, 06 | Approved (PM 2026-10-30) |
| D63 | Listing handoffs award the §7.6 karma values (one closing/karma model, G34); applies from the change on, not retroactively — answers Q-5 | 07.5, 07.6 | Approved (PM 2026-10-30) |
| D64 | Bit / PayBox links to KC are interim transfer links, not clearing: withdrawn automatically once a licensed one-time clearing page exists | 05.5, 08 | Approved |
| D65 | Brand = "Karma Community" (HE "קהילת קארמה"), nickname "KC"; design tokens in code are the source of truth, mirrored to Figma and Claude Design; automated brand guardrails in `pnpm test` | 17 | Approved |
| D66 | Brand font Rubik app-wide (via `@kc/ui` Text/TextInput); AA-compliant light `primary` `#C2410C` (vivid orange for decoration); secondary = logo navy; current `logo.png` is the master | 17 | Approved |
| D67 | Brand system v2: KC = the platform, the KC org is styled like any org, "קיבוץ קפיטליסטי" never shown; radius scale 4/8/12/16/24; tokens for decoration orange, weights and avatars; guard covers colour, type, radius, spacing and RTL sides, and every file a PR touches must be fully clean; admin = same tokens, denser layout; native follows the OS colour scheme | 17 | Approved (PM 2026-10-30) |
| D68 | Operational alerts reach the PM as a GitHub issue (assigned → email) and by email now, and by WhatsApp once the WhatsApp channel is live | architecture §5.2 | Approved (PM 2026-10-30) |
| D69 | Monitoring covers both dev and production; production checks are read-only | architecture §5.2 | Approved (PM 2026-10-30) |
| D70 | One rides flow: ride offers/requests are posts with a ride extension and bookings use the generic handoff stage; the separate legacy ride screens are retired, their emergency button and cost caps move to the one flow | 05.3 | Approved (PM 2026-10-30) |
| D71 | Ride places (origin, destination, ≤ 3 meeting points) come only from official catalogs — cities, streets, named junctions & interchanges; no free-text places | 05.3, 07.2 | Approved (PM 2026-10-30) |
| D72 | Every ride shows its route on the map and every ride place has "navigate" to Waze / Google Maps / Apple Maps | 05.3 | Approved (PM 2026-10-30) |
| D73 | The driver sees every booking on a ride and approves or declines each; every booking change is an `important` push to the other side | 05.3, 07.11 | Approved (PM 2026-10-30) |
| D74 | Saved route: follow a route (from → to, optional days & hours) and get notified of new rides along it; urgent rides notifications bypass quiet hours | 05.3, 07.11 | Approved (PM 2026-10-30) |
| D75 | Rides quick publish (remembered route, time shortcuts, "publish again") and a rides feed of offers + requests sorted by departure, departed rides hidden | 05.3 | Approved (PM 2026-10-30) |
| D76 | Org finance is a sub-tree of every org's Admin Portal; each org (KC included, as the platform org) keeps its own books; new org-scoped roles `org_treasurer` (write) and `org_accountant` (read + export); moderators keep read-only on KC's books | 08, 03 | Approved (PM 2026-10-30) |
| D77 | Section 46(a): KC records the org's approval (number, validity, certificate, expiry reminders) and tracks receipts per donation (number, date, 46(a)-eligible flag, file); KC never generates official receipts; KC itself holds no 46(a) approval today, so no tax-credit wording is shown until the status is active | 08 | Approved (PM 2026-10-30) |
| D78 | Books are single-entry (no double-entry): financial accounts (bank / cash / Bit / Paybox / clearing provider), two-level category tree, calendar fiscal year, budget vs actual, bank reconciliation; ILS only; in-kind giving (items, time, rides) never enters the books | 08 | Approved (PM 2026-10-30) |
| D79 | Finance data sources: manual entry + CSV import (bank, Bit, Paybox, generic) + automatic mirroring of in-app payments, refunds and payouts into the ledger (payment tables stay the source of truth) | 08 | Approved (PM 2026-10-30) |
| D80 | "Smart tracking" = computed reminders and queues (missing receipt, unreconciled, failed standing order, 46(a) and proper-management expiry, annual-report deadline, budget overrun) + counterparty-based auto-categorization, with a daily digest notification to treasurers | 08 | Approved (PM 2026-10-30) |
| D81 | Financial transparency is optional per org and published as frozen yearly snapshots (totals, program vs overhead share, public documents, 46(a) badge) — never live books; donor identities are never public under any setting | 08 | Approved (PM 2026-10-30) |
| D82* | An organization profile is an extended user profile — its own email identity, posts, followers and public page — plus an org Admin Portal whose finance sub-tree is D76–D81; the profile itself is specified as its own domain later | 08, 03 | Approved (PM 2026-10-30); depth pending |
| D83 | Admin portal shows the whole management structure as a layered view across every organization: one layer per level of the reporting chain, with no depth limit (inside an org a manager can report to a manager, down to a volunteer manager and a volunteer), on a masked, count-only community base; the main admin sees all orgs, org roles see their own org (D29) | 03 | Approved (PM 2026-10-30) |
| D84 | A suspended user is a regular community member until an admin decides: suspension hides them nowhere in the management hierarchy and they count in the community; only an admin decision (ban) removes them — refines D61 for the hierarchy and its counts | 03, 07.15 | Approved (PM 2026-10-30) |
| D85 | Admin-portal permissions are role-derived only: each role carries a fixed set of permissions, a person's permissions are the union of their roles', and changing what someone may do means changing their role — no per-person permission overrides; the person screen lists what each role allows | 03 | Approved (PM 2026-10-30) |
| D86 | Every organization runs its own team in the admin portal: its admins and managers (org admin, org manager, volunteer manager, operations manager) enter the team area of their own organization only, see their org's hierarchy and grant, change, move and revoke roles below them within their authority; the main admin sees and manages every organization (refines D29 for team management) | 03 | Approved (PM 2026-10-30) |
| D87 | Brand guard covers components, icons, layers and shadows: new tokens `iconSize` (14/16/18/20/22/24), `zIndex` (base 0 · raised 1 · overlay 2 · floating 20 · toast 9999) and `shadow.glow`, each matching the values screens already used most; the ratchet adds icon-size, z-index, shadow, raw `TextInput` (use `TextField`) and raw `Modal` (frozen until the shared modal, #1284); ESLint allows only Ionicons | 17 | Approved (PM 2026-10-30) |
| D88 | Organization profile = a public profile like a person's, adapted to organizations (logo, cover, what/where, website & social links, contact, badges, posts, followers; later team, activity, impact, transparency). Behind it an organization account: its own sign-in identity **and** members with roles who act in its name from their own accounts via a profile switcher; a private person registering as an org (D57) keeps one account linked to both | 08, 07.12 | Approved (PM 2026-10-30) |
| D89 | Any non-profit organization may register through a self-service wizard + KC admin approval; a registration number is **optional** (declared non-profit status + terms are mandatory); Registrar lookup only enriches when a number is given | 08 | Approved (PM 2026-10-30) |
| D90 | An organization profile is always public (no private mode, follows need no approval); an organization may follow people and organizations | 08, 07.13 | Approved (PM 2026-10-30) |
| D91 | Organizations publish in every world with no post cap; a member may post in the organization's name (card shows the org, detail shows the member only by opt-in). No separate directory screen: Search gets an "ארגונים" parent filter whose sub-filters appear only while it is on; hub directories reuse it with the hub's field pre-set | 08, 07.3 | Approved (PM 2026-10-30) |
| D92 | No custom page layouts or paid design for organizations; one uniform profile template (PRD V2 §3.1.5 stays long-horizon vision) | 08 | Approved (PM 2026-10-30) |
| D93 | Verbal brand: the Founder-approved master narrative §7.4/§15/§16 voice rules become spec 17 §7 (one voice, dugri register, ktiv maleh, jargon ban, locked key slogan "לתת — זה גם לקבל."); gender-neutral copy uses the infinitive ("ללחוץ", "יש ללחוץ"); CTAs ≤ 4 words; English follows the same voice; enforced by the copy-voice guard in `pnpm test` (ratchet + touched-file rule), which makes FR-RESP-006 AC19/AC20 checkable. **Refines D67** (PM 2026-10-30): "קיבוץ קפיטליסטי" may appear subtly on the About screen and in its FAQ only; it stays forbidden everywhere else | 17 | Approved (PM 2026-10-30) |
| D94 | Destructive actions (delete, block, remove) use a red `DangerButton` (`colors.error` fill, `textInverse` label, AA in both palettes); everything else keeps the brand-orange primary | 17 | Approved (PM 2026-11-01) |
| D95 | Rides urgency: booking notifications always bypass quiet hours; a saved-route alert bypasses them only when the ride departs before the quiet window ends; saved-route alerts are capped at 10 per user per day, separate from the 3/day match cap — approves S44 | 05.3, 07.11 | Approved (PM 2026-11-01) |
| D96 | A ride booking the driver has not approved expires 12 hours after it was made or at departure, whichever is earlier, and frees its seats — approves S45 | 05.3 | Approved (PM 2026-11-01) |
| D97 | Rides quick publish defaults: time shortcuts "in 30 min", "in 1 hour", "tomorrow 07:00", "other"; seats default 3 (1–8); estimated end = departure + straight-line distance at 60 km/h + 15 min, rounded up to 15 min, editable — approves S46 | 05.3 | Approved (PM 2026-11-01) |
| D98 | Junctions catalog: Ministry of Transport junction & interchange names (data.gov.il, CC BY) imported by a versioned migration, existing rows only, credited in About, refreshed by script and never fetched at runtime — approves S47 | 05.3 | Approved (PM 2026-11-01) |
| {{D:world-feed-seeker-offerer}} | Every active world screen opens with search and a **מחפש / מציע** (seeker / offerer) toggle over the world's feed: *מחפש* lists the world's open offers and shows a "publish request" button, *מציע* lists its open requests and shows a "publish offer" button; each button opens the one create form preset to that world and direction. Rides keep their single departure-sorted feed of offers and requests (D75) with both buttons | 04, 05, 07.3 | Approved (PM 2026-11-01) |
| {{D:housing-gated-until-id}} | Until ID verification ships (G13), housing keeps D30: the create form shows housing but, for a member who may not publish there, replaces its fields with a "publishing housing requires ID verification — coming soon" notice; the housing world stays a portal | 05.6, 07.14 | Approved (PM 2026-11-01) |
