# KC Product Spec (Project Book) — English, agent-oriented

> **Human source of truth:** the Hebrew page "KC – ספר הפרויקט (מקור אמת)" maintained by the PM (Nave) with the KC assistant. This folder is its English, AI-agent-friendly derivation. If the two disagree, the Hebrew page wins and this folder must be updated in the same week (decision **D35**, **D58**).
>
> Snapshot date: **2026-10-30**. Decisions **D1–D92** included.

## How to read

- `D#` — an approved PM decision. Full log: [`90_decisions_log.md`](./90_decisions_log.md).
- `S#` — a gap the assistant filled by context, **pending PM approval**. Treat as the working assumption, but do not hard-code irreversible behavior on an `S#` alone. List: [`91_kc_fills_pending.md`](./91_kc_fills_pending.md).
- `G#` — an implementation gap: the spec is clear, the code does not match yet. List: [`93_implementation_gaps.md`](./93_implementation_gaps.md).
- Legacy FR-IDs (`FR-POST-*`, …) live in [`../SSOT/spec/`](../SSOT/spec/). Where this folder and a legacy FR conflict, **this folder wins** (D35); legacy files are historical inputs to be reconciled.
- `PRD_V2_NOT_FOR_MVP/` at the repo root is a long-horizon vision source. It is a treasure: **never archive or delete it**; mine it when specifying later phases.

## Update procedure

1. A new PM decision is written into **every** section it touches, tagged `(D#)`; contradicting text is deleted.
2. Update cross-cutting files if relevant: glossary/naming (94), structure (04), roadmap (14).
3. Add a row to `90_decisions_log.md`.
4. An `S#` approved by the PM becomes a `D#`; a closed question is removed from 92; a code mismatch becomes a `G#`.
5. Every dev task / bug cites: spec section + code + automated test.
