# 07 — Cross-cutting systems

Each section ends with a **Tech** line: decisions · legacy spec superseded/kept · code today · gap.

## 7.1 Post, statuses, expiry
Everything published in KC is one `Post` (D2, D16, D19): one giving world + one domain (D45), direction (offer/request), status, visibility, anonymity, location, likes & comments. Special types add an extension — ride, event (D31), housing stay (D30), job (D41). **Handoff is the closing stage, not a type** (D19). An imported WhatsApp post is a normal Post with source `imported` until claimed (S21).

Statuses: `open`, `closed_delivered`, `deleted_no_recipient`, `expired`, `removed_admin`, `hidden_pending_review` (D33).
- **State machine (S1):** `open → (hidden_pending_review ↔ open) → closed_delivered | expired | deleted_no_recipient | removed_admin`; reopen from `closed_delivered` and `expired`, by owner only.
- **Permissions (S2):** edit/delete — owner and super-admin; hide — KC admin; a suspended user cannot create, edit or comment.
- **Expiry by type (D21):** food offer — at expiry date (alert 24h before and at expiry; close at midnight of expiry date, S4); ride offer — 30 min after estimated end; event & ticket — at their date; items and all requests — no expiry; the owner gets relevance reminders instead (D59).
- **Relevance reminder (S3):** 14 days after publish, then every 30 days: "Still relevant?" → bump / close. Bump updates sort time, not `created_at`.

## 7.2 Form and procedure per post type
One form creates a Post: giving world first, then one domain (auto-suggested from text/image, editable, mandatory; no "general", there is "other" — S39), offer/request toggle worded per world, then a type-specific form defined in world config (D6*, D28, D36). Anonymity chosen in the form (D16); affiliated volunteer posts on the org's behalf (D22); emergency templates appear during emergencies (D42). No form in money (D4). Common rules: title ≤ 80 chars, description ≤ 500, ≤ 5 images with EXIF stripped, local draft. Location: offer = address at chosen display level, request = city; max 20 open posts per private user, none for orgs (S34).

| Post type | Photo | Location | Expiry | Unique fields |
|---|---|---|---|---|
| Food offer | required (D28) | address | expiry date | type, allergens, quantity |
| Food request | no | city | none | quantity, urgency |
| Item offer | recommended (S19) | address | none | item subcategory, condition |
| Item request | no | city | none | item subcategory, urgency |
| Ride | no (D28) | origin, destination, ≤ 3 meeting points — official places only (D71) | offer: +30 min | departure, est. end, seats |
| Time / elderly / consulting | no | city or "remote" | none | estimated duration (D32) |
| Event (org) | no | address | date | capacity, registration policy (D31) |
| Housing stay | no | city; exact after approval | stay dates | nights, house rules (D30) |
| Job (org) | no | city or remote | closing date | scope, field, link (D41) |
| Experience | no | venue | date | type, date, seats (D45) |

## 7.3 Feed, sorting, recommendations
Main feed of all worlds plus a feed per world (D5, D36). Default sort = **Recommended** — KC's recommendation engine, aiming to be as smart as Facebook/Instagram (D27). Phase 1 weights (S33): distance, freshness, worlds the user is active in, urgency and near expiry, reliability (never shown), posts with no response yet; region weight during emergency. The user always controls: sort (recommended/new/old/near) and filters (world, domain, item subcategory, direction, people/orgs, city+radius, status). Inside a chosen sort the engine may boost ≤ 1 of every 5 items, labeled "Recommended" (S5). Sort choice persists per session; a new session returns to Recommended (S7). A **Friends / Everyone** toggle hides on scroll down and returns on scroll up, TikTok-style (D34); "Friends" = people I follow, default Everyone (S6). Emergency items go on top with a banner (D42). Hidden-for-review posts don't appear (D33). Notify only on good match or saved filter (D10).

Tech: · FR-FEED-001 "no algorithm" superseded; MATCHING_V2 score ≥ 0.60 kept · `PostFilterSheet`; matching on `listings` · G15 · world hubs (items/food): item subcategory + distance-from-home filters on `browse_listings` (`0469`, KC#1102/#1111) · native items/food listings reach the feed as mirror posts (`posts.listing_id`, `0466`, D-206 — a step toward G1)

## 7.4 Card and detail screen
Uniform card and detail for all types (D2, D6*): image or world icon, world/direction/status chips, title, description, location & time, publisher per anonymity (D16) with verification level (D23) and **no rating** (D24), likes & comments (D25), fixed action button and report (D33). Closing button per type (D11, D17); event → register (D31); job → apply (D41); imported post → "Is this yours? Claim it" (S21). Color/icon from world config (D36). **Domain not shown on the card** — at most a tiny corner icon (D45). Needs further design depth (D6*).

## 7.5 Closing and handoff
Each post type has its own closing flow on a generic handoff stage (D17, D19): "mark delivered", "ride completed", "stay completed", "volunteering done", "I attended". Closing earns karma (D12, D29), opens a two-sided internal rating (D15), and for volunteering follows 7.10 (D32). Auto-close on expiry (D21). Reopening reverses the karma (S20). Intermediate stages later.

Tech: · FR-CLOSURE-001–010, FR-RIDE-031–034 · three separate state machines today · G1

## 7.6 Karma
All engagement earns; closed giving earns most (D12). Visible only to the owner; the main admin sees all (D29). All values in **one global config `KARMA_POINT_VALUES`**, tuned later by research/KPIs. All values are estimates except "existing" (S20); undo/removal reverses points; daily caps. Emergency: +50% on giving in the declared world & region (S28).

## 7.7 Ratings
After each handoff both sides rate 1–5 with a note — one generic rating for all types (D15, D19). **Users never see ratings, not even their own**; only KC admins (D24). Ratings feed the trust engine.
Tech: · FR-RIDE-037 kept; FR-RIDE-038 superseded · `ride_ratings`, `giving_handoff_ratings` currently readable via RLS · G4 · items/food/rides/knowledge handoffs: rating step = pick 1–5 stars, optional note (≤300 chars), submit (`HandoffRatingForm`, KC#1106/#1114); "Rating given" karma (7.6) tracked in KC#1306

## 7.8 Chat
One conversation per pair; contacting from a post pins it (D13). Closing from chat (D17). Group chat only around a project/challenge/event, locked at the end. Suspended users can still talk to support (D33).
Tech: · FR-CHAT-004–016 · implemented · –

## 7.9 Likes and comments
On every post type: like & comment, and like & reply on comments (D25), one thread level (S8). Comment on an anonymous post shows the commenter's name; anonymous poster replies as "the poster" (S8). Delete: author, post owner, admin; 3 reports hide a comment (S9). Earn karma, create notifications, reportable.
Tech: · `06_feed` "not in MVP" superseded · `PostEngagementSection`, migration 0250 · G12

## 7.10 Volunteering and hours
Every registered user may offer volunteering (D22); karma is automatic (D32). Org-affiliated volunteers log hours approved by their manager; unaffiliated volunteers don't log hours — the duration declared by the poster counts at closing, up to 8 hours per post (S14). Applies to time, elderly, consulting, sport coaching, tech volunteers.
Tech: · R-Time-1 superseded · none · G19

## 7.11 Notifications
Rich model like Instagram/Facebook/WhatsApp (D26): notification center grouped by time and unread (D7), smart grouping ("X and 3 others liked"), badge, per-type and per-channel preferences, mute chat/post, groups `important` and `social` (S10: push for important, in-app only for social; group per post per hour), quiet hours (default 22:00–08:00), max 3/day for matches & recommendations. A third group `emergency` bypasses quiet hours only in the declared region and only if not disabled (D42, S28). Rides are time-critical: booking changes are `important` (D73), and saved-route alerts follow their own urgency rule and daily cap (D74, {{D:rides-urgency-rule}}).
Types: match & saved filter (D10), ride booking & saved route (D73, D74), expiry & relevance (D21), like & comment (D25), event (D31), hours (D32), report & suspension (D33), emergency (D42), challenge (D43), community poll (D40), imported post awaiting claim (S21).

## 7.12 Profile
Avatar, name, city, bio, counters; posts in "Open" / "Closed" tabs (D2, D14) — no "marketplace listings" tab. Verification level and reliability data shown (D23); rating not (D24). Karma, active challenges and volunteering log — owner only (D29). Exportable volunteer CV later. **Organization profile**: same shape adapted to organizations (logo, cover, type, fields, links, badges, team opt-in, activity, impact, transparency), always public, reached at `/org/{slug}` (D88–D92).
Tech: · FR-PROFILE-001–006 · FR-ORG-003 (`20_organizations`) · `ProfileMarketplaceListings` adds a "marketplace" tab · G6

## 7.13 Anonymity, privacy, location
Visibility `Public / FollowersOnly / OnlyMe` and counterpart masking, chosen in the form and changeable **both ways** (D16). The counterpart in a handoff sees the real name. Location: `CityOnly / CityAndStreet` (default) `/ FullAddress`; profile shows city only; housing exact only after approval (D30). EXIF stripped. WhatsApp import keeps no identity of non-members (S21). No commercial use of community data.
Tech: · PRD_V2 rule 7 superseded · both ways on `posts` (0094) and `listings` (0451) · G3 ✅

## 7.14 Verification and trust engine
Levels phone → ID → blue check, plus reliability data (completed handoffs, seniority), shown on post, card and profile (D23). **Not blocking**, including drivers. Exceptions: housing — both sides verified; medical — only medical bodies (D30); elderly home visit — ID-verified volunteer (D48); an event may require verified users (D31). The trust engine weighs ratings and reports in ranking/matching and reports anomalies to admins (D24). ID provider chosen at implementation.
Tech: · PRD_V2 rule 13 superseded · phone only · G10, G13

## 7.15 Reports and moderation
Anyone can report a post, comment or user. **3 reports on a post → hidden until human review, and admins are notified; 5 on a user → suspended from actions, still sees everything and can chat with support** (D33, D61). "5" = 5 distinct reporters within 30 days; suspended user's open posts are hidden (S11). Review within 48h; malicious reports count against the reporter (S12). False emergency reports are handled with priority (D42).
