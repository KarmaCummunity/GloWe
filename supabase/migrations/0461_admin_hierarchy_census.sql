-- 0461_admin_hierarchy_census — FR-ADMIN-028 layered hierarchy census.
--
-- Read-only aggregate that powers the admin portal "layers" view: the levels
-- of the management chain standing on a masked community base.
--
-- The RPC returns counts only — never identities — for the parts of the view
-- that are not named role-holders:
--   • community_total     every community member (the masked base);
--   • role_holder_total   distinct members holding ≥1 active grant
--                         (subtracted from the base so nobody is counted twice);
--   • orgs[].affiliated_count
--                         distinct members with a volunteer-type
--                         `org_memberships` row in that org and no active grant
--                         there. Memberships are self-declared, so they are
--                         surfaced as an aggregate and never as named people.
--
-- A community member is an account that is active or suspended: a suspended
-- user stays a regular member until an admin decides (project book D79).
-- Banned, deleted and unverified accounts are not members.
--
-- Named role-holders keep flowing through `admin_org_tree` (migration 0203),
-- so identity visibility stays governed by a single RBAC predicate.
--
-- Visibility mirrors `admin_org_tree`: a community member holding an active
-- grant may call; super_admin
-- sees every org, everyone else only the orgs their own grants reach
-- (platform-scoped grants resolve to the platform org).
--
-- Mapped to spec: FR-ADMIN-028 (docs/SSOT/spec/12_super_admin.md §17).
-- Decisions: D-195; project book D78, D79.
