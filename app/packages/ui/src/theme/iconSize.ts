 * Glyph sizes for Ionicons, in points. The six steps are the six sizes screens
 * already used most (14–24, about 85% of the literal `size={N}` uses when the
 * scale was set), so adopting the tokens causes no visual change.
 * Hero / illustration glyphs (32+) are not icons in a row of text and stay
 * outside the scale with an allow-marker until a surface needs a shared step.
