 * FR-DONATE-011 — resolves how a donor can support KC directly.
 *
 * The server-configured channels are the single source of truth (D20: the
 * provider is swappable without a release; D59: interim links are withdrawn
 * once clearing exists), so there is deliberately no compiled fallback — a
 * load failure propagates as `KcSupportChannelsError` and the UI shows the
 * "unavailable" state instead of possibly stale payment links.
