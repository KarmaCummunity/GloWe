// Resolve what .github/workflows/deploy.yml deploys, and refuse anything CI
// did not pass.
//
// The deploy runs on `workflow_run` (a CI run, or a version-bump run, on a
// dev/main push finished) or on `workflow_dispatch` from dev/main. Either way
// it judges one exact commit: the triggering run's head SHA, or the
// dispatched ref's SHA — never "whatever the branch tip is by the time a job
// starts". It then requires, via the GitHub API, that:
//   • the commit is still the branch tip — a slower CI run of an older commit
//     must not overwrite a newer deploy (the newer commit's own CI triggers
//     its deploy) — with one exception, the version-bump child below;
//   • a push-event CI run for that commit succeeded with its `CI gate` job
//     successful (a dispatch cannot deploy an ungated commit);
//   • prod only: the commit is the merge commit of a merged dev → main PR of
//     this repository (no direct pushes, no PRs from forks or other branches).
// A workflow_run must also come from ci.yml or the bump workflow of this
// repository; either is only a wake-up call, since certification is always
// read from ci.yml's runs through the API.
//
// Version-bump inheritance (dev only, TD-231). bump-version-on-merge.yml
// pushes a `[skip ci]` commit right after every merge into dev, so the dev tip
// usually has no CI run of its own. Such a commit may deploy on its parent's
// certification when ALL of these hold (bumpCommitErrors): its only changed
// file is app/VERSION, it has exactly one parent, its author or committer is
// the bump workflow's git identity, and its subject is the bump workflow's;
// and the parent has a successful push-event CI run with a green `CI gate` on
// dev or main. The bump commit itself is deployed, so the built
// /version.json carries the new VERSION and the dev tip's SHA. Any other
// shape fails closed: a non-bump tip is "moved on" (skip), an ungated commit
// is refused.
//
// Triggers. A `[skip ci]` commit gets no CI run, so no `workflow_run` ever
// names it. Two triggers cover both orders in which the merge's CI run and
// the bump finish:
//   • CI run of the merge finishes: if the bump child is already the tip,
//     deploy the child (inherited); if not yet, deploy the merge itself.
//   • bump run of the merge finishes: deploy the bump child only if the
//     merge's CI gate is already green (CI finished first and deployed the
//     merge without the bump); otherwise skip, because the CI run's own
//     completion will deploy the child. It never deploys the merge itself, so
//     it cannot duplicate the CI-triggered deploy.
// A duplicate deploy of the child is possible only when CI finishes in the
// seconds between the bump's push and the bump run's completion; deploys are
// idempotent and serialized per environment, so that costs time, not safety.
//
// deploy.yml runs this file from its own commit (github.workflow_sha), never
// from the commit being judged.
//
// Env: EVENT_NAME, REF, SHA (github.sha), WORKFLOW_RUN (toJSON of
// github.event.workflow_run, or empty), GITHUB_REPOSITORY, GITHUB_TOKEN.
// Outputs ($GITHUB_OUTPUT): deploy (true|false), target (dev|prod), branch,
// sha (the commit to deploy: the judged commit or its bump child).
